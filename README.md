# Predictive-Supervised-Modeling-for-Agriculture
Identify the single soil feature that has the strongest predictive performance for classifying crop types.

Find the feature in the dataset that produces the best score for predicting "crop".
From this information, create a variable called best_predictive_feature, which:
Should be a dictionary containing the best predictive feature name as a key and the evaluation score (for the metric you chose) as the value.

Hint:Training a multi-class classifier algorithm.
